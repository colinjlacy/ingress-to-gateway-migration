# Canary Deployment - Weighted Traffic Splitting
# This demonstrates progressive traffic migration from v1 to v2
# 
# Key Difference from Ingress-NGINX:
# - Ingress-NGINX requires TWO separate Ingress resources with canary annotations
# - Gateway API uses ONE HTTPRoute with weighted backendRefs
# 
# This is a major improvement: all routing logic is in one place!
#
# IMPORTANT: Delete 51-httproute-version-app.yaml before applying this!
#   kubectl delete httproute version-app-route -n demo-gw-migration
# Both files match /version which causes conflicts.

# Comparison Notes:
#
# INGRESS-NGINX APPROACH (2 resources):
#   1. Primary Ingress:
#      - path: /version -> version-app-v1
#   
#   2. Canary Ingress (separate resource):
#      - annotations:
#          nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
#          nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "10"
#      - path: /version -> version-app-v2
#
# GATEWAY API APPROACH (1 resource):
#   - Single HTTPRoute with weighted backendRefs
#   - All routing logic in one place
#   - Easier to understand and maintain
#   - Native Kubernetes API (no vendor-specific annotations)
